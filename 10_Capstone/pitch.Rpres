Predict Next Word
========================================================

The goal of this project is to make a web application which takes user input and outputs the three most likely predictions for the next word.

The web app is hosted on:

The source code can be consulted at:

Shiny Application
========================================================

The application uses the Shiny tool in R. It involves a text prediction algorithm to predict the next 1-3 words for any given input.

More specifically, the algorithm is an n-gram algorithm. An n-gram is a continuous sequence of *n* words from a given string of text.

The algorithm was trained using a sample from a very large dataset coming from blogs, news and Twitter sources. The most popular n-grams were found from this sample and then used to build the actual algorithm.

The result is a quick, responsive and accurate prediction algorithm, which is similar to what we have nowadays in our phones.

The Algorithm
========================================================

All in all, the dataset was over 4.2 million lines. The sample was brought down to 800,000 lines. 

This sample was then "tokenized" and cleaned (e.g. removing profanities, numbers, hashtags, etc.)

As text is entered by the user, the algorithm goes from a 4-gram down to a 2-gram to detect a match. The actual choice for the prediction is the longest, most frequent matching n-gram. This is efficient as it uses a back-off strategy, instead of going from lower n-grams to higher ones.

Application UI
========================================================

It takes less than a second after you have finished writing the input before the app comes up with the predictions automatically. 

The slider below the input box allows you to change how many predicted words you would like to have displayed.
