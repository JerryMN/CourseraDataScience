## Overview

This presentation is the assignment for week 3 of the Developing Data Products course. It was created using R Markdown and next in the slides is a plot created with the **plotly** package.

## Description of the map

The plot shows the capitals of all countries grouped by continent (x-axis) and population (y-axis), using data from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_capitals_by_population) and [here](http://techslides.com/list-of-countries-and-capitals).
