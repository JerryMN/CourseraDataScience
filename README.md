# README

This is my repository for the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization course on Coursera.

Here is all the work I have developed throughout the specialization. I have tried my best to group them into the adequate folders and adding a description, but it may or may not be complete. 

The website where you can find the links (instead of browsing the folders awkardly here) is https://jerrymn.github.io/CourseraDataScience/
